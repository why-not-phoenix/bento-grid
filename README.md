## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was pretty easy all things considered. Had a bit of difficulty with the grid placement but resolved to having 2 containers and that helped. My major difficulty would be using semantic html and keeping with the design.

### Continued development
